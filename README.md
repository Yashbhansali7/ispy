# rooftop_ispy

A new Flutter project.

I've setup the basic authentication: login and register. I have created and added the logic of creating a game and how it will be played but due to time constraints with my current job, I haven't created the UI and calling those functions or display different custom widgets based on the stage the game is at but you can get a good idea on what I have worked on and how the game is going to be played. 

Note: I've kept the repository public because there was no account mentioned in the assignment that i could've shared with
